# MAS417thomas
This repository contains the files used for the MAS417 project.
Used python as the coding language and openweather as the weather API 

How to run the program: 
The program can be run from pycharm or any suitable IDE. Pycharm is tested and functional.
To run the program the user needs to run the text2png script which prompts the user to enter a location. 
The API have been able to pull weatherdata from all tried cities from all over the world.

The script then proceeds to fetch the temperature for the asked location at this moment in time. This is then used to generate an STL file showcasing the temperature data as a 3D-object.
To view the file it needs to be manually opened in a 3D viewer program such as Ultimaker Cura.
